## API 

As you can see the Api is in the **app.py** folder!
The admin accounts is admin@localhost to edit any of the databases. 

Start by signing up to the API then login to the API to be rediredcted to dashboard. 

The API it self is a order-user forms allowing users to place orders onto their account with a specific order. This will allow 2 tables to access a foreign key of User ID and show which user places which order, also showing the name and User ID.
